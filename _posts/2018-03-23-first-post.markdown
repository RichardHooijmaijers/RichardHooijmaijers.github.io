So this is my first post. It's kinda boring because it is only intended to see if everything works and I understand a little bit how jekyll does it's magic. Hopefully future posts will be a bit more exciting :)



<!-- There are some things I want to keep as template:
code blocks:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
{% endhighlight %}
handling of urls:
in text you can write [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] and then at the end something like:
[jekyll-docs]: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home -->
