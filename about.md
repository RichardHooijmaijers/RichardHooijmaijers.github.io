Hi, my name is Richard Hooijmaijers and I am mainly involved in R programming. Furthermore, I am doing data analysis and modeling
in the field of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD).
I really enjoy building packages and applications to make the life of data scientists a bit easier. My main interests are
data visualizations and (shiny) app development, but basically everything that is new and exciting in the field of data science.
